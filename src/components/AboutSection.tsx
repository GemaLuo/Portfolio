              Hi, my name is WenJun and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">{"highly ambitious"}</span>,
              <span className="font-bold">{" self-motivation"}</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold">{" driven"}</span> software engineer
              based in Taiwan.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I graduated from National Tsing Hua University in 2022 with a
              Bachelor of Humanities and Social Sciences, specializing in both
              Chinese Literature and Laws. Due to my immense interest, I pursued
              self-study and currently transitioned into a career as a Front-End
              Engineer. I am dedicated to continuous learning and mastering
              programming languages.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy.
              From gardening, doing yoga, learning language, making pour-over
              black coffee. I am always seeking new experiences and love to keep
              myself engaged and learning new things.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I believe that you should{" "}

                never stop growing
              </span>{" "}
              and that's what I strive to do, I have a passion for technology
              and a desire to always push the limits of what is possible. I am
              excited to see where my career takes me and am always open to new
              opportunities.ðŸ˜Š
